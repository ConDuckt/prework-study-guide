        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The style attribute can be used inline or as an internal style sheet, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
            <li>The selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
            <li>The * selector is used to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
            <li>Selectors can be combined into a single CSS rule with a comma.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
            <li>The margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>CSS style sheets must be linked to the HTML code to go into effect.</li>

            <li>The console.log method outputs a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
            <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed.</li>
            <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>
            <li>All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
            <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
