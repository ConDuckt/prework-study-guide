# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My primary motivation was to learn how to use Git/GitHub properly.
- I've taken intro coding lessons before but never got very far. This is the first time I've deployed and actual project.
- Additionally, I established a notetaking rubric for my upcoming bootcamp (may or may not update).
- I learned that deploying a project isn't as intimidating as I may have once thought.


## Installation

N/A


## Usage

Each section contains my personal notes taken throughout the development process of this project. Since this was developed thru step-by-step instruction, the notes are rudimentary and foundational, but nonetheless useful (to me at least.) JS is running in the console (hence the subheading.) 


## License

MIT. Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.
